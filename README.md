# NFT COLLATERALIZED LENDING PLATFORM
The NFT Collateralized Lending Platform is a Decentralized platform that allows users to collateralize their NFTs, borrow against their value, and retrieve their assets by repaying the loans. This contract-based system leverages Chainlink oracles and ERC-721 standard for NFT interoperability.

## Overview
The NFT Collateralized Lending Platform is designed to help users access funds by putting up their NFTs as collateral. Built on Ethereum, it offers a streamlined way to borrow against the value of digital assets. With the Diamond Standard, each contract component can be upgraded individually, ensuring flexibility and scalability as the platform grows.

## Features
* **NFT Collateralization:** Lock up NFTs and get access to loans in ETH or supported tokens.
* **Flexible Loan Terms:** Set loan amounts, interest rates, and durations based on your needs.
* **Real-time NFT Pricing:** Integrated Chainlink oracles for accurate collateral valuation.
* **Collateral Liquidation:** Automatic liquidation for overdue loans.
* **Modular Design with Diamond Standard:** Flexible upgrades and easy maintenance.

## Diamond Standard Details
The Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) lets us package the platform‚Äôs functionality into ‚Äúfacets‚Äù within a single contract.

* **Diamond Proxy:** The main contract for delegating to facets, this contract holds the data of the System and performs call to  the facets using the Low-Level EVM (delegate) calls.
* **Selectors:** Maps function selectors to facets.
* **Facets:** Contracts that handle a specific set of tasks (like collateral or loan management). This contracts defines the implemetation Logic of the contract (platform)

## Smart Contract Components
1. **Collateral Management Facet:** This Facet locks NFTs as collateral and handles their release or liquidation.
**Main Functions:**
**lockNFT():** Locks the NFT as loan collateral.
**releaseNFT():** Returns the NFT after loan repayment.
**liquidateNFT():** Liquidates NFT in case of default.

2. **Oracle Facet:** This facet is set to interacts with Chainlink oracles to fetch real-time NFT prices.
**Main Functions:**
**setNFTPrice():** This sets the price of an NFT,
**getNFTValue():** Returns the latest price of an NFT.
**calculateCollateralValue():** This function calculate/updates the value of the NFT against a collateral price.

3. **Loan Management Facet:** This facet manages loan creation, repayment, and tracking.
**Main Functions:**
**createLoan():** Starts a new loan.
**repayLoan():** Handles loan repayments.
**checkLoanStatus():** Checks the status of a loan.

4. **Interest Rate Management Facet:** This Facet implements thevLogic that calculates and updates loan interest rates.
**Main Functions:**
**calculateInterest():** Calculates interest for each loan.
**setBaseInteresRate():** Allows updates to interest rates.

5. **Governance Facet:** This facet controls platform governance and permissions.
**Main Functions:**
**createProposal():** Adds new users with permissions.
**vote():** Allows proposing changes to platform settings.

## Oracle Integration
The platform uses Chainlink oracles to fetch up-to-date pricing information, which helps determine loan values for NFTs. The Chainlink integration makes sure that collateral is accurately valued when you borrow or repay.

### How it Works:
Configure Chainlink as a pricing data source.
Use AggregatorV3Interface for price data.
Include error handling for oracle or network issues.

`Note`: A lot of improvements are still needed so contributions are welcome!!

Bonus: The [DiamondLoupefacet](contracts/facets/DiamondLoupeFacet.sol) uses an updated [LibDiamond](contracts/libraries//LibDiamond.sol) which utilises solidity custom errors to make debugging easier especially when upgrading diamonds. Take it for a spin!!
